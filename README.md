The objective of Blackjack is to have a hand value of 21 or as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. Face cards (Jack(J), Queen(Q), King(K)) have a value of 10 and Aces(A) can have a value of 1 or 11.

## Technologies Used: 
JavaScript, HTML, CSS

## Getting Started:

To start the game place a bet. (press the "Bet" button)

At the start of each game, the player starts out with $100 to bet with. The player and dealer are each dealt two cards. The player's cards are face up while the dealer has one card face up. 
            
The player can choose to "hit" to draw another card in an attempt to improve their hand value. The player can hit as many times as they want, but if their hand value exceeds 21, they lose the game.
            
Once the player decides to "stand", the dealer will reveal their face-down card and continue to draw cards until their hand value is at least 17. If the dealer's hand exceeds 21, the player wins. Otherwise, if the dealer's hand value is greater than the player's, the player loses. If the dealer's hand value is less than the player's, the player wins. If both hands have the same value, it is a "push" and no one wins or loses.
